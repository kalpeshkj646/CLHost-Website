This repo contains the first website I created using HTML and CSS concepts.

The website is CLHost, which serves the purpose of cloud hosting. It is a dummy website I created referencing one YouTube video.

It is a multi-page website that uses CSS concepts of Flex and Grid and how we should do styling properly using utility classes.
